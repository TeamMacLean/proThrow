        <h3>In gel - Gel slices:</h3>

        <p>Please cut gel bands into cubes (approx. 2-3mm) so that they sit at the base of the tube. Do not mash the gel
            into very tiny pieces as these can block the autosampler.
            Do not expose the gels to dust/hair/skin contamination. Use gloves, clean containers, clean scalpel,
            dust-free solutions throughout the procedure.</p>

        <h3>In solution - Precipitates:</h3>

        <p>In general use as pure chemicals in the sample preparation procedure as possible. Old chemicals of dubious
            origin typically contain detergents, polymers (e.g. PEG) and other “chemical background” that can severely
            compromise LC-MS performance.

            Please state (below) which detergents you have used at ANY stage of your sample preparation – including the
            initial extraction buffer. This is critical as some detergents contaminate HPLC column, the mass spec and
            reduce its performance for everyone. Among the known problematic compounds belong commonly used SDS,
            Triton-X-100, Tween and PEG.</p>

        <p>Please note that we may ask you to help with protein digests. This contribution is usually asked in case of
            long term projects, with submission of 20+ samples, or when temporary overload of samples to process occurs.
